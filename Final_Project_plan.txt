There were several program ideas that we came up with. 
We have listed these ideas below.

    - Shooter game (similar to Duck hunt)
    - Maze ( might be too hard to code)
    - Frogger Type game **** ( This is the game we picked)
    - Tetris type game
    - Astroids *****
    - Pinball
    - Pong
    - Matching card/symbol game *****
    - Galliga
    - Space Invaders ******

Ultimatlly we decided to go with the game Frogger.
we did like the other games that we put the **** symbol by
however wtih the interest of time we think Frogger is challenging enough
for 2 people where the others would need 5.
